dotmyown - My personal dotfiles
===============================

Description
-----------
dotmyown is my way to manage my work and development environment on multiple machines and accounts. It is slim, handy and super simple.  
I used [blackwinters](http://blackwinter.de/) [dotme](https://github.com/blackwinter/dotme) for the last two years (thanks for that), but it always was much more customisation than I've ever used. So I made my own.

Installation and usage
----------------------
Clone the repo

    git clone git://github.com/pattex/dotmyown.git

Install gems

    cd dotmyown
    bundle install

Run the setup

    ./setup.rb

That's it.
